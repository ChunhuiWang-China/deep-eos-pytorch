# Deep-EOS PyTorch
## Introduction
This is a pytorch implementation of "Deep-EOS: General-Purpose Neural Networks for Sentence Boundary Detection" (Schweter et al, 2019).
Go here for the original Keras implementation: [https://github.com/stefan-it/deep-eos](https://github.com/stefan-it/deep-eos)

Currently only the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models are implemented.

The dataset download script and dataset creation methods are largely copied from Stefan Schweters repository.

## Download
The trained models can be downloaded in the releases section.
The each model 7zip archive contains the best scoring model (on development data) out of 5 epochs,
alongside with its corresponding vocabulary.

The datasets can be downloaded with the ``download_data.sh`` script from the original implementation.
